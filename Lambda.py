# Lambda

# A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
# A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

# Syntax
# lambda arguments : expression

# The expression is executed and the result is returned

# lambda power2

p = lambda num : num**2

print(p(2))
print(p(3))
print() #empty line

# Why Use Lambda Functions?
# The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function.

# Use lambda functions when an anonymous function is required for a short period of time.
