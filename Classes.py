# Classes/Objects

# Python is an object oriented programming language.
# Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
# A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
# Create a Class

# To create a class, use the keyword class:

class A:
    x=50
    
# Create Object
# Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects

o1=A()

print(o1.x)
