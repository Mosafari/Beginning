# The while Loop
# With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

i = 0
while i < 10:
    print(i)
    i+=1
    
print() #empty line



# Note: remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.
# The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready,
# in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.
