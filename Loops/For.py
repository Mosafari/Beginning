# For Loops

# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
# This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
# With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

A = "string"
B = 5 #num
C = ['a','b','c','d','e','f']
D = (2,4,6,8,10)
E = {1,1,2,3,4,5}
F = {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3, 'd':4}

# The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.

# loop through string
for char in A :
    print(char)
    
print() #empty line
