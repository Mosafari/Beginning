# Dictionaries

# Dictionary
# Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
# A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
# As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
# Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:

D = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

# Dictionary Items
# Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.
# Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.

# Ordered or Unordered?
# As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
# When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
# Unordered means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.

# **Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key**
